This is an multi-cycled implementation of a processor for the Tangled instruction set.
\end{abstract}

\section{General Approach}

Our AIK specification of Tangled is largely based on the sample solution provided by Dr. Dietz, with a few changes. Namely, we added two additional possibilities for the first 4 bits of the instruction: \texttt{Start} and \texttt{Decode}. \texttt{0xd} was available, so we used that for \texttt{Start}. However, at this point, we were out of hex numbers for the first 4 bits. So, we combined the instructions that were originally categorized under both \texttt{0x7} and \texttt{0x8} to only \texttt{0x7}, leaving \texttt{0x8} available for \texttt{Decode}.

The main body of our processor involves using a case statement on the first 4 bits of the instruction. Sometimes, that is sufficient to distinguish which instruction we should use, but if not, we nest a second case statement on the second 4 bits of the instruction to further determine which instruction to use.
