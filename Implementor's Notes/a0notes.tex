\begin{abstract}
This is an multi-cycled implementation of a processor for the Tangled instruction set.
\end{abstract}

\section{General Approach}

Our AIK specification of Tangled is largely based on the sample solution provided by Dr. Dietz, with a few changes. Namely, we added two additional possibilities for the first 4 bits of the instruction: \texttt{Start} and \texttt{Decode}. \texttt{0xd} was available, so we used that for \texttt{Start}. However, at this point, we were out of hex numbers for the first 4 bits. So, we combined the instructions that were originally categorized under both \texttt{0x7} and \texttt{0x8} to only \texttt{0x7}, leaving \texttt{0x8} available for \texttt{Decode}.

The main body of our processor involves using a case statement on the first 4 bits of the instruction. Sometimes, that is sufficient to distinguish which instruction we should use, but if not, we nest a second case statement on the second 4 bits of the instruction to further determine which instruction to use.

\section{Testing}

\section{Issues}

% I ran into two major issues while writing this project. In the first, I had a conflicting number of passing cases depending on whether I was running my project on my local machine versus Dr. Dietz's web CGI interface. I asked him for any insight and he revealed the cause of the discrepancy was a timing error in an \texttt{always} block in my \texttt{onesub} module. I was triggering the block on a change of inputs \texttt{a} or \texttt{b}, instead of the result \texttt{secondOut}. This caused a race condition that lead to some cases passing on my machine that failed on the web interface.

% I later learned that I was actually barred from using an \texttt{always} block at all, so I needed to find a new way to assign the remainder \texttt{r} without it. To do so, I replaced my case statements with nested \texttt{?:} statements.
